INTRODUCTION                                 *easyoperator-phrase-introduction*

vim-easyoperator-phrase provides a much simpler way to use some operator for
phrase in Vim.

    Select, yank, paste, delete, or other operation of phrases.

The idea of this plugin is based on supasorn's work on vim-easymotion

    https://github.com/supasorn

Note: to promote good Vim habits, you should learn standard movement
commands like `}}, vi(, va(, %, ][, ]], [(, etc.` before resorting to
this function.

==============================================================================
REQUIREMENTS                                 *easyoperator-phrase-requirements*

vim-easyoperator-phrase depends on vim-easymotion plugin, version 2.0

https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion

Vi-compatible mode must be disabled.

==============================================================================
DEFAULT MAPPINGS                         *easyoperator-phrase-default-mappings*

    Select, yank, paste, delete, or other operation of phrases.

Default mappings:

        {operator}<Plug>(easymotion-prefix)p

    NOTE: Default <Plug>(easymotion-prefix) is <Leader><Leader>

The default configuration defines the following mappings in visual and
operator-pending mode. If you want to map by yourself, set following to 0.
>
    let g:EasyOperator_phrase_do_mapping = 0
<
Default: 1

==============================================================================
CUSTOM MAPPINGS                           *easyoperator-phrase-custom-mappings*

<Plug>(easyoperator-phrase-select)         *<Plug>(easyoperator-phrase-select)*
        xmap: Select phrases by two consecutive call of EasyMotion.
        omap: Operate on selected phrases

<Plug>(easyoperator-phrase-delete)         *<Plug>(easyoperator-phrase-delete)*
        Delete phrases by two consecutive call of EasyMotion, and jump back to
        original cursor position.
>
<<Plug>(easyoperator-phrase-yank)             *<Plug>(easyoperator-phrase-yank)*
        Yank phrases by two consecutive call of EasyMotion, and jump back to
        original cursor position.

Example:
>
    omap <Leader>p  <Plug>(easyoperator-phrase-select)
    xmap <Leader>p  <Plug>(easyoperator-phrase-select)
    nmap d<Leader>p <Plug>(easyoperator-phrase-delete)
    nmap p<Leader>p <Plug>(easyoperator-phrase-yank)
